        <p>
          We noticed a request <em> (hopefully from you) </em> to change your GMS Sure trade transaction pin.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to verify and establish trust with the request to some level of certainty,
          and that you are the one who initiated this request to reset the transaction pin, we require
          an otp verification of your identity.
        </p>
        <p> In order to proceed, kindly enter the 6 - digit otp to continue </p>
        <p> <h1 style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center"> {otp} </h1> </p>
        <p> Note that the otp above expires in {expiresIn} </p>

        <p>
          If you did not initiate this request, it might appear that your account is under threat. Therefore,
          you should reach out to the operation team as soon as possible. The contact of the operation officer is
          shown below.
